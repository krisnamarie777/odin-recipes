This is the Recipes Project for The Odin Project Curriculum.

In this project I brushed up on basic html which was super easy for me.  

However learning Git was hard, especially since I must have misspelled my recipe names in the files.  This made me have to learn how to move files, so I could rename them.  I also, at one time, had improperly staged one of my files so I had to start over.

I am not, going to publish this project so it can be seen on the previewed on the web at this time.
